# VBL_DADA2_pipeline
Tutorial and files for DADA2 Bioinformatic pipeline with ITS amplicon sequences
The pipeline below is mainly focused on DADA2 pipeline presented by Benjamin Callahan et al. in its [ITS](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ITS_workflow.html) and [16S](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) variants. The pipeline follows closely the DADA2 mentioned previously, the work of Mareli Sánchez Juliá for her MAMF project, and Farrer Lab at Tulane University, using ITS amplicon sequences from Mimulus spp. leaf tissue.
